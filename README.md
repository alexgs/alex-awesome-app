# Phil's Awesome App

My "Awesome App" starter kit for Webpack 2 and React.

## What's Missing

1. React HMR appears to work without using the [`AppContainer`][3] component.
2. CSS preprocessing, such as Sass
3. Extracting included CSS with the [Extract Text plugin][4]
4. Tree-shaking in Babel

## Useful References

- [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Webpack 2 and Module Bundling][5] has some good examples of Sass bundling and URL resolving.
